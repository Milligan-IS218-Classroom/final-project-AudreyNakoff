        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p>I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado on June 20th, 2002 to Jennifer and William Johns. My mother was a
            highschool math teacher and my father was enlisted in the United States Air Force.

            Washington. While living there, my second brother was born on September 22, 2005.
            We moved in 2008 from Washington to the United Kingdom, where we lived for 4 years, returning to the states
            in 2012.
