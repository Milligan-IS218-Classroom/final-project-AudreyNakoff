        <h1>My Life</h1>
        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p>I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado on June 20th, 2002 to Jennifer and William Johns. My mother was a highschool math teacher and my father was enlisted in the United States Air Force.
            Shortly after I was born, my dad was deployed for 6 months to South Korea. And so, my mother and I moved to Texas to be closer to her parents while he was away. It was while we were in Texas that the first of my two biological brothers was born on October 27th, 2003.
