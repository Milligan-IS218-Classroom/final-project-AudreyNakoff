        <h1>My Favorite Anime</h1>
        <p>
            In recent years, I have really gotten into Japanese animated series, called anime, and the comic forms,
            called manga. Here is a table of some of my favorites, what form of media it is, a short synopsis, and where
            to read or watch each one.

                        During the late 19th century, Great Britain has become the greatest empire the world has ever
                        known. Hidden within its success, the nation's rigid economic hierarchy dictates the value of
                        one's life solely on status and wealth. To no surprise, the system favors the aristocracy at the
                        top and renders it impossible for the working class to ascend the ranks.

                        William James Moriarty, the second son of the Moriarty household, lives as a regular noble while
                        also being a consultant for the common folk to give them a hand and solve their problems.
                        However, deep inside him lies a desire to destroy the current structure that dominates British
                        society and those who benefit from it.

                        Alongside his brothers Albert and Louis, the trio will do anything it takes to change the filthy
                        world they live in—even if blood must be spilled
